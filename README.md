# mask_money_text

You can use this mask in Text widgets, not for Inputs.

<h4>In Brazil the standard is a comma instead of a dot to separate the cents. And place a dot every 3 places(right to left) to be better visible(You can adjust as you prefer).</h4>

<h3>Input: 130999564.96  -> Output: 130.999.564,96</h3>

how use:
mask-money_textField('VALOR A SER FORMATADO'.toString());
